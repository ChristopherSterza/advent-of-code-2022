# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code is a yearly advent calendar full of daily coding puzzles; one for
each of the twenty-five days of Christmas.

In this repo, I will document the daily problems and post my solutions to them
(time permitting). I will also be attempting to solve the puzzles in python this
year to familiarize myself with it more.

The Advent of Code website for the 2022 calendar can be found
